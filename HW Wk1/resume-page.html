	<h2>Experience</h2>
		<p>I am computer savvy, with experience in both Windows and Mac. Some applications I have worked with are Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator. I also know a lot about Microsoft Office.

They were very logical in their arguments and publications. During my spare time, I enjoy watching movies, and playing video games. I also like to sketch, and enjoy painting with acrillics.</p>
