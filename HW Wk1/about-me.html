	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h2>Web Development Student</h2>
	<p>My name is Gurgen Sargsyan. I am a free thinker, an artist, and a computer wiz. I like to excercise, and recently got into jogging. I would like to go to the beach more often, especially during this summer's heat. I was born in Yerevan, Armenia, half way across the world. I grew up in the San Fernando valley, and love the weather here. I like to hang out with my friends and go places. My favorite foods are In-N-Out, Zankou chicken, chinese food, lasagna, pizza, oh, and sushi. I like all types of music but my most listened to genres are Hip-Hop and Electronic. I like to follow famous DJs like Kaskade, Deadmau5, and Sander Van Doorn. I still listen to alot of old school rap. I have a big family, and I am the oldest sibling. I graduated UCLA with a bachelor's in Philosophy. My college years are over now, but I am continuing my education at GA - a web development school.</p>
